    `- Performance improvements: cache the inputs to this flow and short-circuit on stale data.`,
    ``,
    `3. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS`,
    `- Components to update: identify the screen(s) tied to the "${f.category}" subsystem (e.g. Ride screen, Wallet screen, Driver dashboard, Admin panel).`,
    `- Loading behavior: render a skeleton that mirrors the final layout — never a blank screen or full-page spinner.`,
    `- State handling: manage with React Query (or an equivalent async hook) so retries, caching, and invalidation are consistent.`,
    `- Backend: add/repair the relevant Supabase trigger, scheduled function, or RPC needed to keep this state self-healing.`,
    ``,
    `4. UX IMPROVEMENTS`,
    `- Add a 200ms fade-in when real data replaces the skeleton.`,
    `- Provide an explicit "Retry" action when an automated recovery attempt fails twice.`,
    `- Show a compact status pill (color-coded) so users understand whether the system is healthy, degraded, or recovering.`,
