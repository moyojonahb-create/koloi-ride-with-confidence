## External Console Checklist

### Google Maps — fix `ApiTargetBlockedMapError`

1. Go to **Google Cloud Console** → [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Select your project (or create one).
3. **Enable APIs** (APIs & Services → Library):
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API (New)
   - Geocoding API
   - Directions API / Routes API
4. **Billing**: ensure a billing account is linked (Maps JS API requires it).
5. **API Key restrictions** (APIs & Services → Credentials → your key):
   - Application restrictions → **HTTP referrers (web sites)**
   - Add these referrers:
     ```
     http://localhost:*
     http://localhost:5173/*
     https://your-production-domain.com/*
     ```
   - API restrictions → **Restrict key** → select the APIs listed above.
6. Copy the key and set it in `.env`:
   ```
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIza...yourKeyHere
   ```
7. Restart `npm run dev`. The map should render without errors.

### Supabase Realtime — fix WebSocket failures

1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard** → [app.supabase.com](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Select project `jidfganntquilvsytslp`.
3. **Database → Replication**:
   - Ensure **Realtime** is enabled for the `live_locations`, `rides`, `offers`, and `messages` tables.
   - For each table: click **Enable** under the "Realtime" column.
4. **Authentication → Policies**:
   - Verify RLS policies allow `SELECT` for the anon/authenticated roles on the tables above.
   - Realtime uses the same permissions as `SELECT`.
5. **Settings → API**:
   - Confirm `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `.env` match the dashboard values.
6. Restart `npm run dev`. Open the browser console — you should see:
   - `[Supabase] Realtime connected` (no WebSocket errors).
   - Live driver location updates flowing through `live_locations`.
