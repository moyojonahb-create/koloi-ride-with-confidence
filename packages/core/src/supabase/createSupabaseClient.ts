/**
 * Supabase client factory with the auth storage adapter injected.
 *
 * The web app hardcodes `brokeredPreviewStorage()`, which brokers the session to
 * the Lovable editor over `window.parent.postMessage` and falls back to
 * `localStorage`. That is definitively browser-only — three DOM globals in one
 * adapter — and is the single thing preventing the client setup from being
 * shared. React Native passes AsyncStorage here instead; the realtime tuning,
 * which is not platform-specific and was arrived at against this backend, is
 * shared unchanged.
 *
 * The web app's version also renders its misconfiguration error by assigning to
 * `document.body.innerHTML`, which would itself throw on React Native. Config
 * validation lives in defineCoreConfig() instead, and each platform renders the
 * failure however it renders failures.
